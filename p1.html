<h2>Why programming language is popular?</h2>
<p>There are a wide variety of issues that may lead to a language being 
one of the most-used programming languages. Some of these 
programming languages just because they are widespread and versatile 
are among the most popular.

<p>Programming language is important because it defines the
 relationship, semance and grammar that allows programmers to
 communicate effectively with the machines they are programming.
A programming language serves several purposes: You can teach the
 computer what to do in a human-readable form, Allows the 
programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, 
etc. This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" that a
 group of developers can develop, providing portability-one computer's
 low-level instructions will differ from that of Programming has enabled
 new interactive web applications which have access to system
 resources and provide the same level of control as desktop 
applications , particularly in web development. These applications, used
 on online learning platforms, have enabled distance-learning programs 
to take off. Today nearly all major learning institutions have some 
of implementation of online learning.</p>
  
<p>Computer programming principles implemented today will likely 
influence how technologies such as voice-recognition, artificial
 intelligence and other sophisticated technologies will change in the 
future and how they will be applied to our day-to-day lives. For example
, the trend toward automating Internet searches and purchases to be 
more localized is ongoing. While the hardware platforms developed will
 play a major role, computer technology will likely be at the center of it
 all and programming future systems will be an important aspect.</p>
