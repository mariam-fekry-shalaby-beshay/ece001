<h2>Programming languages</h2>
<p>A program is a collection of guidelines which follow the rules of the 
language chosen. Computers are useless without programmes. It's like 
a recycling system. Lists the components (called variables) and a list of
 instructions (known as statements) to show the computer what the
 variables should be.Vocabulary and collection of grammar (syntax)
 rules; For instruction to perform different tasks on a computer.
programming languages can be used to build computer applications.
Commonly, the term programming language refers to.languages of high
 quality such as BASIC, C, C++,COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal,and Ada.</p>
<h2>Programming languages history</h2>
 <p>In 1883, when a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with Charles 
Babbage on his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine, 
he created his first computer programming language. Although
 Babbage was concerned with calculating numbers clearly, Lovelace 
saw that the numbers in which the machine operated could represent 
anything more than pure quantities of items. She wrote an Analytical 
Engine algorithm, which was the first of its kind. Lovelace gets credited 
with creating the first computer programming language because of her 
contribution. As different needs emerged and new devices were
 developed, a lot more languages followed.</p>

 <h2>Computer Programming Languages Today</h2>
 <p>Most computer programming languages were inspired by concepts 
from previous computer programming languages or built upon them. 
While older languages still serve as a strong foundation for new ones 
today, newer computer programming languages simplify the work of 
programmers. Businesses rely heavily on programs to satisfy all their 
data, transactions and customer service needs. For their study, science 
and medicine need specific and complex programmes. Mobile apps
need to be updated to meet consumer demands. And all of these new 
and growing needs ensure that computer programming languages, both
 old and new, will remain an important part of modern life.</p>
