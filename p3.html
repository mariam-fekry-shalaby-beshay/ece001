 <h2>Programming languages Table</h2>
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>It is a language that is dynamic, (bytecode-compiled). Source code does not include type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods. This makes the code short and flexible, and you'll lose the source code compile-time type check. At runtime, Python monitors the types of all values and flags code that doesn't make sense while they run</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Java</td>
    <td>The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language. It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ruby</td>
    <td>Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object oriented, general purpose programming language. Ruby is a pure Object-Oriented language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. In Ruby, everything is an entity except the blocks but there are also substitutes for it, i.e. procs and lambda. The purpose of Ruby 's development was to make it act as a sensible buffer between human programmers and the underlying computing machinery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTML</td>
    <td>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language which defines your content structure. HTML consists of a collection of elements that you use to enclose, or cover, various sections of the material in order to make it appear in some way, or to behave in some way. The enclosing tags can hyperlink a word or picture to another location, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller and so on .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JavaScript</td>
      <td>JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in 1995, it’s gone a very long way since its humble beginnings.Being the first - and the only - scripting language that was supported natively by web browsers, it just stuck. it was mainly used for fancy animations and the marvel known at the time as DHTML. With the growing needs that the web platform demands, JavaScript had the responsibility to grow as well, to accommodate the needs of one of the most widely used ecosystems of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
    <td>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C++</td>
   <td>C++ is a general-purpose programming language which was designed to provide object-oriented paradigm as an enhancement of the C language. It is a compiled language and an imperative. C++ is a middle-level language that offers the advantage of low-level programming (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUIs, desktop applications, etc.). Both C and C++ have the same basic syntax and code structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C#</td>
    <td>C # is a general purpose programming language, modern and object-oriented, pronounced as "C Sharp." It was developed within the framework of the. NET initiative by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team, and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and the International Standards Organization ( ISO). C # is among Common Language Infrastructure Languages. C # is syntactically much like Java, and is simple for users who learn C , C++ or Java.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Objective-C</td>
      <td>Objective-C is an object-oriented, general purpose programming language that applies Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. This is Apple's primary programming language for the OS X and iOS operating systems and their respective APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. This guide will take you to learning Objective-C programming language through simple and practical approach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PHP</td>
     <td>PHP started as a small open source project, expanding as more and more people became aware of how useful it was. The first version of PHP was released by Rasmus Lerdorf back in 1994.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SQL</td>
    <td>SQL stands for Language Structured Query. Essentially, it is a language that allows to communicate with databases to manage all the data contained therein. This area is what we use to detect spam bots. When you fill in this, you are generally marked as a spammer. SQL is pronounced like "sequel." However, it's a matter of preference (like gif vs. jif)—some people pronounce it as all three letters in acronym form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Swift</td>
      <td>Swift is a perfect way to write apps, whether it's running tablet code, desktops , servers, etc. It's a free, fast, and interactive programming language that blends the best of modern language thought with the wisdom of Apple's broader culture of engineering and its open source community 's diverse contributions. The compiler is optimized for results, and the language</td>
